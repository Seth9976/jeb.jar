JEB3, the latest major update, is now available to all users. Below is a high-level summary of the changes.

- New desktop client, lighter and faster. The JEB3 client also ships with a dark/solarized theme, and supports custom keyboard shortcuts.
- Major upgrades to the native analysis pipeline. The decompilation pipeline is accessible and customizable at different stages, which we will detail in coming blogs. We published part 1 of a series on writing custom IR optimizers and AST optimizers.
- New decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts (evm) and WebAssembly modules (wasm). As of JEB 3.1, JEB ships with 8 decompilers: dex/dalvik, x86, x86-64, arm, arm64 (aarch64), mips, wasm, and evm. A large chunk of our effort this year will be focused on continuing our work on the native analysis and decompilation (eg, advanced optimization modules, release of the C++ reconstruction plugin, open-sourcing of advanced optimizers, etc.).
- Type libraries for Windows, Linux, and Android-Linux sub-systems for common architectures (x86, x86-64, arm, aarch64). Power users can also generate their own typelibs (eg, for cusotm SDKs), as we presented on our blog.
- Signature libraries for common library code on Windows (all versions of Visual Studio static libs) and Linux-Android (common NDK libs from NDK v11 onward).
- Windows malware analysis and Android SO native files is enjoyable and practical with JEB. Combined with powerful, custom IR optimizers, the analysis of complex code is also possible.
- Interactive global graphs. The desktop client provides this experimental feature, whose goal is to provide global, smart views of a program. More to come, including API to access the CFG graphs, callgraphs, and create cusotm graphs.
